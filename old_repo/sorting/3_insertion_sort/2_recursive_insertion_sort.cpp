/*Recursive Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
Below is an iterative algorithm for insertion sort

Algorithm



// Sort an arr[] of size n
insertionSort(arr, n) 
    Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
       a) Pick element arr[i] and insert
          it into sorted sequence arr[0..i-1] 

Refer Insertion Sort for more details.

How to implement it recursively?
Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion.

If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm, we keep processed elements sorted and insert new elements one by one in the inserted array.

Recursion Idea.

1. Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.
2. Recursively sort first n-1 elements.
3. Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.

// Recursive C++ program for insertion sort 
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

// Recursive function to sort an array using 
// insertion sort 
void insertionSortRecursive(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
	// Base case 
	if (n <= 1) 
		return; 

	// Sort first n-1 elements 
	insertionSortRecursive( arr, n-1 ); 

	// Insert last element at its correct position 
	// in sorted array. 
	int last = arr[n-1]; 
	int j = n-2; 

	/* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
	greater than key, to one position ahead 
	of their current position */
	while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > last) 
	{ 
		arr[j+1] = arr[j]; 
		j--; 
	} 
	arr[j+1] = last; 
} 

// A utility function to print an array of size n 
void printArray(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
	for (int i=0; i < n; i++) 
		cout << arr[i] <<" "; 
} 

/* Driver program to test insertion sort */
int main() 
{ 
	int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}; 
	int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 

	insertionSortRecursive(arr, n); 
	printArray(arr, n); 

	return 0; 
}
