/*
Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes

Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm.
In computer graphics it is popular for its capability to detect a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2n). For example, it is used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their x coordinate at a specific scan line (a line parallel to x axis) and with incrementing y their order changes (two elements are swapped) only at intersections of two lines
